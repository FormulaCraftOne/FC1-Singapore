# FC1-TemplateMapRepo

[**Direct Download**][dl-latest]


Cleanup checklist before committing to repository:

* exclude the files/folders listed in .gitignore
* for the files in the /data folder, pretty much it's only scoreboard.dat that's consistently required to make command blocks work. Sometimes there's also maps used which means that idcounts.dat and the map_\*.dat should be kept.
